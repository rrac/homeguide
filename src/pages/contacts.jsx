              Ruby, the cat was rescued from the Orange County Animal Shelter in
              2006. She was according to her documents between 2 and 4 years
              old. At likely 16 years of age now, she is more prudent and with
              her vision slightly diminished, she has a harder time estimating
              what it takes to either jump over or on to something. She is
              afraid of loud noises, so if a truck comes up the hill and makes a
              rucous, she will head for the indoors. She is very loving and will
              be on the patio when you are. Normally, she will be in the garden
              for a short while, luxuriating in the sun and then come in and
              nap. She never crosses the bounderies of the patio and garden.
              Please don't ever feel restrained because of the care for the
              animals, there is sufficient help to jump in and help out,
              everyone is more than willing to give you a hand.
