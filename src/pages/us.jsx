          <h3>Jan Connal</h3>
          <p>
            With retirement at the doorstep after a 39 year career in academia,
            as a professor, several Dean positions, the Director of Transfers
            and counseler I am ready to embark on a set of new challenges. I
            will continue my role within 3CSN, a California statewide
            initiative, where "service learning" will be a new challenge
            awaiting me in the coming year. In the meantime, I am trying to get
            some travel-bugs out of my system before I turn my attention to
            these new endeavors. I love to garden and visit gardens wherever
            they may be on my travels. Hidcote in the Cotswolds might be one of
            my favorites so far. My lifelong intense focus on research is ever
            literally at my fingertips ... exploring new things to read, to
            understand and to pursue are always only a few keyboard strokes
            away.

          <h3>Ron Connal</h3>
          <p>
            All things mechanical have always piqued my interest. After a
            botched attempt at becoming an architect, I submerged myself in all
            matter mechanical and got saddled with a degree in
            Electro-Mechanical Engineering, then furthered that with some
            Industrial Engineering while working at Ford Tractor in Antwerp,
            Belgium. While dipping my toes in "data processing" at both Ford and
            Ingersoll Engineers, in Brussels at the time, I participated as a
            consultant engineer in the US, Taiwan, Germany, France, UK and the
            Netherlands on large industrial project for government and
            non-government entities. A software development side track from that
            period turned into a full fledged passion when moving to the US.
            Retired for many years, I am still at it in order to keep the brain
            cells going, however my love of cooking now often takes a front row
            seat.
