            <p>
              I love spending time with my family, friends and pets. And, while
              I consider myself a “homebody” who enjoys her home, patio garden
              and neighborhood, I am looking to expand my horizons. Upon
              retiring from a 39-year career in academia, I am eager for more
              travel, exercise, volunteer and non-academic learning experiences.
              Since I love to garden, I especially want to visit gardens near
              and far. Hidcote in the Cotswolds might be one of my favorites so
              far.
            </p>

              To maintain my professional contributions, I intend to join the
              ranks of adjunct counselors/instructors and continue my
              coordinator role with the California Community Colleges’ Success
              Network (3CSN). Within this realm I am especially interested in
              helping students and fellow faculty embrace Community Based
              Learning.

            <h3>Ron Connal</h3>
            <p>
              All things mechanical have always piqued my interest. After a
              botched attempt at becoming an architect, I submerged myself in
              all matter mechanical and got saddled with a degree in
              Electro-Mechanical Engineering, then furthered that with some
              Industrial Engineering while working at Ford Tractor in Antwerp,
              Belgium. While dipping my toes in "data processing" at both Ford
              and Ingersoll Engineers, in Brussels at the time, I participated
              as a consultant engineer in the US, Taiwan, Germany, France, UK
              and the Netherlands on large industrial project for government and
              non-government entities. A software development side track from
              that period turned into a full fledged passion when moving to the
              US. Retired for many years, I am still at it in order to keep the
              brain cells going, however my love of cooking now often takes a
              front row seat.

            <h3>Ruby Connal</h3>
            <p>
              Ruby, the cat was rescued from the Orange County Animal Shelter in
              2006. She was according to her documents between 2 and 4 years
              old. At likely 16 years of age now, she is more prudent and with
              her vision slightly diminished, she has a harder time estimating
              what it takes to either jump over or on to something. She is
              afraid of loud noises, so if a truck comes up the hill and makes a
              rucous, she will head for the indoors. She is very loving and will
              be on the patio when you are. Normally, she will be in the garden
              for a short while, luxuriating in the sun and then come in and
              nap. She never crosses the bounderies of the patio and garden. AT
              THE MOMENT PLEASE KEEP HER INSIDE AT ALL TIMES, PARTICULARLY IN
              THE EARLY MORNING AND AT DUSK, WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. PACKS OF
              COYOTES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKING FOR
              DOMESTIC ANIMALS, SMALL DOGS AND CATS. PUT RUBY IN THE BACK AND
              CLOSE THE DOOR IN THE HALLWAY BETWEEN THE BACK AND THE FRONT OF
              THE HOUSE. MAKE SURE SHE HAS SOME WATER. A TOWER WITH DRY FOOD IS
              ALREADY IN PLACE. Please don't ever feel restrained because of the
              care for the animals, there is sufficient help to jump in and help
              out, everyone is more than willing to give you a hand.
