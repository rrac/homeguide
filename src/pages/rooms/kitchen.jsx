              You will find a small controller to the right of the sink that
              controls the lights under the top cupboards in the kitchen, step
              back a little into the middle of the kitchen, point the controller
              to the stove and to the right of the sink, press the on or off
              button to operate the under-cupboard lights. Alternatively just
              point to the different sides and press the on or off button. We
              leave those lights on all day until bedtime. If you like to play
              around with mood lighting, you can change the intensity and/or the
              color of the lights.

              I love to cook, so the kitchen is Ron's terrain. It should have
              everything to comfortably cook about anything you can come up
              with. If you are into "sous-vide" cooking, I have an induction
              plate that uses an iPhone application. It can be operated without
              using the app since temperatures of the water can be kept very
              precise. If you are interested in experimenting with it, please
              don't hesitate to use it. The device to pull the air out of
              plastic bags as if you were freezing an item are in the cupboard
              next to the oven and microwave. You submerge the airless bags in a
              pot of water that is kept at a constant temperature for a given
              amount of time depending on the food item. There are many sites on
              the internet that discuss sous-vide. Set the temperature, when the
              desired temperature has been reached, slide the food packet in the
              water bath, set a timer and take the food out when it's ready.
              Easy for steaks and fish and always done exactly right. There is a
              mini flame thrower to crust the meat or fish as if it was cooked
              in a pan in the top cupboard to the left of the hood or you can
              just use one of the iron skillets to quickly brown meats or crust
              fish ...

              Coffee - there are 3 alternatives here. Don't be daunted by the
              coffee machine, it looks impressive, but it can be mastered fairly
              easily. A brief guide for the machine and the grinder is in a
              folder in the basket on the component cabinet. The other
              alternative is the French Coffee Press. It is in the cupboard to
              the left of the hood. The coffee grinder can be set to grind for
              either device. For the expresso type coffee, the grind is very
              dependent on the bean, it's roasting hardness and many other
              things, so you need to experiment if you want to try another bean
              than what is in it or I have in the cupboard, which is more of the
              same, the machine is set to 4P or near there ... for the French
              Press, try 7, 8 or 9, which should be quite coarse. We also have a
              Nespresso system in case you wanted to use it - please carefully
              look at the markings on the coffee pods, we have (3) different
              sizes - expresso for the small cups and a 5/7 oz size of the
              larger cups. The hood, has 2 vent motors and the middle switch is
              for the lights. In the bottom drawer under the electric oven you
              will find some French baking silpats for baking cookies or any
              other stuff on a metal baking sheet.

              The dishwasher is a Miele that is easy to use. The little soap
              packets are under the sink in a box with a blue lid (Costco). The
              right most button is the on button, you press it and in the little
              read-out window on the left it will show a total time it will run,
              just close it and it will start running. You can open it at any
              time and add or remove stuff, close it and it will continue to
              run. There should be enough salt and rinser in the system so use
              it as much as you want. In the event you see a notification in the
              small read-out on the left top of the door for either Rinse
              Solution or Salt Replenishing ... you can override the message by
              turning the appliance off and then back on. Rinse solution is
              under the sink, salt to replenish the dishwasher is behind the
              louvre door in the first part of the hallway. They are Miele grey
              boxes, the funnel shaped device to aid pouring the salt into the
              bottom of the dishwasher under the lower basket is next to the
              boxes of salt. The dishwasher has (3) pull out trays, top is for
              cutlery and silver, middle is for cups, saucers, glasses, desert
              dishes, etc ... the bottom is for larger dishes, pots and/or pans
              and anything that does not fit in any of the (2) top ones. All
              dishes, glasses etc ... are in the cupboards facing the outside of
              the house (sink side). The stainless steel cutlery is in the
              drawer left of the stove. The silver is in the small sideboard in
              the eating nook, right hand drawer. Additional silver is in lined
              boxes on top of the sideboard. There is a picnic basket on top
              also in case you want to head to the beach or grassy knolls above
              the beach on Ocean ... or anywhere else. The two larger drawers in
              the kitchen opposite the sink have all the kitchen gadgets you
              probably need. From spatulas to cheese cutters, to ice cream
              scoops to peelers, bottle openers and can openers etc ...

              We don't use the gas oven much. The electric oven is much faster,
              gets to a much higher temperature and is much more stable. Above
              the electric oven is a micro-wave.

              The garbage can in the kitchen is actually a garbage compactor and
              sits to the right of the stove. Step on the pedal at the bottom to
              slide it open. You can throw about anything in there. Don't worry.
              The city only just started collecting segregated items a short
              while ago ... the recycling can is under the sink, you need to
              pull out the large drawer to get to the top.

              The sink has a garbage disposal - mostly for left over food items,
              you can rinse everything off your plate or whatever it was you
              have cut off from fruit or vegetables prior to preparing and flush
              it down the sink, with the water running, use the switch to the
              right of the window to run the disposal (like macerator for Brits
              or sailors). Try not to put items in there like potato peels or
              large pieces of fruit and vegetables.
